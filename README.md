# Binance ETH Mining
Utilising Pheonix Miner on the Binance ETH mining pool.

# Mining Requirements.

1. An Internet connection.
2. A GPU with more than 4GB of memory.
3. Make sure to have the graphical drivers for your GPU installed.
4. An Ethereum wallet to hold your crypto currencies in.
5. A mining pool address. Typically you'll need to specify this within the bat file. 
But since we're utilising Binance's mining pool you won't need too unless you would
want to use your own mining pool.
